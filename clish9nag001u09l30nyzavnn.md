### Introduction:

Well well, my exams are done and I'm a free man now with all this time on hand I will enjoy writing some silly blogs.. So Picture this an old laptop hiding in the dark depths of my storage closet, longing for a chance to prove its worth again. Little did it know that its time had come!

In a world plagued by <mark>pesky ads</mark> and <mark>creepy trackers</mark>, I embarked on a wild journey to transform my trusty old laptop into an AdGuard server. Brace yourself for a tale of triumph, tech wizardry, and the obliteration of annoying ads from my home network. Buckle up, because this is going to be one hell of a ride!

### Step 1:

Resurrecting the Forgotten Hero, Imagine the dramatic scene of me pulling the dusty old laptop out of its long-term hiding place. Cue the heroic Zelda music! With a twinkle in my eyes (not really) and determination in my heart, I knew this underdog of a machine had a chance at redemption. After all, who doesn't love a good underdog story?

### Step 2:

The Quest of the Perfect OS, Choosing the right operating system was like finding the perfect partner-in-crime for my laptop-turned-server. I needed *something reliable, robust, and, most importantly, cool*. Enter Ubuntu Server, the shining knight in Linux armor! It's like the <mark>Batman of operating systems</mark>â€”lightweight, powerful, and ready to save the day. Installing it was easier than ordering a pizza. Yum!

### Step 3:

Enter the AdGuard Home, Our Mighty Protector, With **Ubuntu Server 22.04** up and running, it was time to unleash the ultimate weapon against those obnoxious ads. AdGuard Home, my superhero sidekick, swoops in to save the day!

Armed with its DNS-level filtering powers, AdGuard Home knocks out **ads, trackers, and even malicious websites**, <mark>like a ninja with a heart of gold</mark>. Setting it up was as easy as slaying a few dragons (and by dragons, I mean running a few commands).

### Step 4:

Customizing and Saving the Day, Now that the server and AdGuard Home were locked and loaded, it was time to customize my Adguard instance. With a few clicks here and there, I configured AdGuard Home to fit my specific needs. It's like putting a badass cape on my server and giving it a cool catchphrase: "No ads shall pass!" With every tweak, my home network became a fortress of ad-free bliss.

### Step 5:

Sharing the Love, Having conquered the ad-infested realms of my own network, it's time to share the love and spread the knowledge! I wouldn't leave my fellow internet warriors hanging, right? I'll document my epic journey in a way that even my tech-challenged friends can understand. Together, we'll rise against the ad invasion and enjoy a peaceful online experience.

### Conclusion:

In a world overrun by ads, my old laptop rose like a phoenix from the ashes to become an AdGuard server, a mighty protector of my home network. With Ubuntu Server as its trusty sidekick and AdGuard Home as its powerful weapon, the laptop-turned-server now battles the forces of intrusive ads and trackers. No longer forgotten and collecting dust, my old laptop has become a hero, and it's just the beginning of an I.T adventure.
